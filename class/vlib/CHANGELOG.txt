CHANGELOG
------------

4.0.2.3
-------------------

*   [General] Fixed bug where Error constants threw a notice when re-defining themselves. Kelvin Jones (2004-01-07)
*   [vlibTemplate] Fixed bug where the loop context vars (i.e. __ROWNUM__) now work with the CASELESS option. 
    Kelvin Jones (2004-02-10)

4.0.2.2
-------------------

*   [vlibTemplate] changed template "format" option to call PHP function if not found in vlibTemplate::FORMAT_TAGS array. 
    PHP function must accept 1 argument only. Kelvin Jones (2003-11-24)

4.0.2.1
-------------------

 *  [vlibTemplate] removed Call time reference from Db functions for Forward Compatibility. Kelvin Jones (2003-11-13)


4.0.2
-------------------

 *  [vlibTemplate] added option to vlibIni.php for 'ENABLE_SHORTTAGS' this is to toggle between the new functionality
    of being able to use <VAR ...> instead of <TMPL_VAR ...> ...etc. It is off by default for backwards compatibility
    sake. Kelvin Jones (2003-07-23)
 *  [General] Deprecated the Release notes file as it is no longer useful due as I use the changelog for everything now.
    It will still be held in CVS for historical purposes but will no longer be distributed. Kelvin Jones (2003-07-23)


4.0.1
-------------------

 *  [vlibTemplate] added ability to reference a global variable from within <TMPL_INCLUDE> tags, i.e. 
    <TMPL_INCLUDE file="{var:header}" /> would include the file set by: $tmpl->setVar('header', ...);.
    Kelvin Jones (2003-07-23)
 *  [vlibTemplate] bugfix when calling ob_start() from _parse() causing output buffering to fail in some configurations.
    Kelvin Jones (2003-08-06);


4.0.1RC
-------------------

 *	[vlibMimeMail] validateEmail was case-insensitive. changed from ereg to preg_match. Kelvin Jones (2002-12-11)
 *	[vlibTemplateError] Added error message for when a loop name is not specified. Kelvin Jones (2002-12-13)
 * 	[vlibTemplate] added a getLoop() function for use with the 3-step-loop process. This returns the loop in an array
 	and removes the internal loop from $this->_currloop. Kelvin Jones (2002-12-13)
 *	[vlibTemplate] fixed bug in addRow() function which caused it to not recognize the last loop set using newLoop()
 	when not specifying a loop name. Kelvin Jones (2002-12-16)
 *	[vlibDate] added Russian language pack. Kelvin Jones (2003-01-02)
 *	[General] Renamed old CHANGELOG to RELEASENOTES.txt and created CHANGELOG.txt for tracking all changes made, big
 	or small. Kelvin Jones (2003-01-02)
 *	[General] Created CONTRIBUTIONS.txt, a guide for how to develop on vLIB. Kelvin Jones (2003-01-02)
 *	[General] Added new class, vlibSearchToSQL. This allows you to convert a boolean search string to SQL. Kelvin Jones
 	(2003-02-13)
 *	[vlibIni] Added config params for vlibSearchToSQL.
 *	[vlibSearchToSQL] Added getStoppedWords() and getShortWords() functions to return the words that were excluded from
 	the search for that particular reason. Kelvin Jones (2003-03-03)
 *	[vlibTemplate] removed the 9th capture from the regex which checked for a new line. This was pretty much useless, and also
 	didn't work in particular versions of php. Kelvin Jones (2003-03-03)
 *	[vlibTemplate] added the ability to omit the TMPL_ bit of the tag, so you can write <VAR name="title" /> now. This
 	is completely optional. Kelvin Jones (2003-03-03)
 *	[vlibTemplate] fixed bug that caused a "undefined variable" notice to be thrown when using a TMPL_INCLUDE. Kelvin
    Jones (2003-03-07)
 *  [vlibTemplateCache] fixed bug pointed out by Andre in the forum, which caused a recache every time in certain circumstances.
