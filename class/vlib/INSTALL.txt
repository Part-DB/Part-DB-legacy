INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS
---------------------------

The vLIB Library has been built to be installed with minimal changes needed.
The following steps will guide you through the install proceedure:

1) Download the current version of vLIB from http://vlib.activefish.com/download/

2) Unpack the version of vLIB that you downloaded (eg: vLIB_3-0-6.zip) into a directory of
   your choise accessible to your php scripts.

3) Read the LICENCE file. Using vLIB in your applications testifies your agreement with this
   software licence.

4) If you are installing vLIB then see 4a. If you're upgrading vLIB then see 4b.

    4a) Rename the file vlibIni.php-dist to vlibIni.php.
        Open vlibIni.php and edit the configuration parameters to suit your needs. If you need any help
        then please refer to the documentation in the /docs/ directory.

    4b) As you are upgrading you probably do not want to overwrite the configuration parameters that
        you have already set in vlibIni.php. So what you need to do is copy each configuration parameter
        from your current vlibIni.php file into vlibIni.php-dist. It should be straight forward as the
        parameters should be completely backward compatible and therefore the parameter names should
        not have changed.

        ***************************************************************************************************
        NB: From version 3.0.3, the old ini.php file has been replace with vlibIni.php. This is now a class
        which which is included once, and not an array which was included every  time it was needed. This
        change was made to increase performance.
        If you're upgrading to this version, it does not mean an immense change in your installation.
        You just need to copy all values from your old ini.php file to vlibIni.php. It should be straight
        forward.
        ***************************************************************************************************

        Once you are happy that you have copied all of your original parameters into vlibIni.php-dist you
        should backup you current vlibIni.php file to say vlibIni.php.bk. All you need to do now is rename the
        vlibIni.php-dist file to vlibIni.php.

        ****************************************************************************************************
        NB: There was a major renaming change in the upgrade from vERSION 2.0.2 to 3.0.0 as the names
        of all classes are now called vlib* instead of v*, i.e. vTemplate is now vlibTemplate.
        Therefore you must now update any files which you used with the vTemplate class to use vlibTemplate.
        If you do not, you will not be able to use the new versions of vLIB.
        This is the only naming change I can see in the future. It was made because of conflicts with
        other php classes.
        ****************************************************************************************************

5) Now have a look in the /examples/ directory. You may need to change these files slightly depending on
    your configuration. For example if you install vLIB directly into a webserver accessible directory,
    then you should be able to run these files as they are. Otherwise you may need to copy the files to
    an appropriate directory and change the include paths to vLIB.

    However you do it, you should be able to make them work without to much fuss. If not then visit the
    vLIB homepage at http://www.activefish.com/vlib/ to see if you can find something to help you out.
    Alternatively you can look at the vLIB forum at http://www.activefish.com/vlib/forum/.


NB: Make sure that you read the LICENCE file (step 3).
